# design

## Overview

The `src/design` directory appears to hold design-related code for the project. Based on the current content, this directory primarily contains placeholder or test scripts. The provided file `test.js` seems to be a stub or a simple test file without functional code or logic implemented yet.

## Key Components and Their Responsibilities

- `test.js`  
  - Currently functions as a placeholder or test script.  
  - Contains no executable code or defined functions/classes.  
  - Intended for future development or testing purposes.

## Dependencies and Requirements

- No dependencies are declared or required in the current state of the code.  
- The environment should support ES6 JavaScript syntax at minimum.

## Usage Examples

Since `test.js` contains no executable code or exported modules, there are no usage examples available at this point.

## Important Notes and Considerations

- The directory and existing file appear to be under early development or serve for internal testing only.  
- No public APIs or configuration options are currently defined.  
- Please update or replace `test.js` with meaningful design logic to enable useful documentation and usage instructions.  
- Contributions to this directory should include adequate code, tests, and usage examples to enrich this documentation.
