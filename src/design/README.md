# design

## Overview

The `src/design` directory appears to be intended for design-related code within the project. Currently, it contains a placeholder or test file (`test.js`) which does not implement any functionality. This indicates that the design module is either in early development or serves as a template for future design code.

## Key Components

- **test.js**  
  This test file currently has no implementation. It may be used for initial testing, experimentation, or scaffolding future design components.

## Dependencies and Requirements

- As this directory currently contains only an empty test file without dependencies, there are no specific dependencies or requirements to list for this module at this time.
- General project dependencies apply based on the broader project environment.

## Usage Examples

Since `test.js` contains no code or exported functionality, there are no usage examples to provide currently.

## Important Notes and Considerations

- The `src/design` directory is under initial setup or placeholder status.  
- To maintain clarity, consider removing or populating the `test.js` file with meaningful code to represent this module's purpose.  
- Future updates should document public APIs, classes, and functions once implemented.  
- Keep this README up to date as the module develops.
