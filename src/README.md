# MVPS Hosts File Blocker

## Overview

This TypeScript module exports a comprehensive MVPS (Mike's Voids Proxy Service) hosts file designed to block advertising, tracking, and potentially malicious domains. The hosts file is a curated list of IP address mappings that prevent connections to known ad networks, trackers, and unwanted domains by redirecting them to the local machine (0.0.0.0).

## Key Features

- Blocks a wide range of advertising and tracking domains
- Supports both IPv4 (0.0.0.0) and IPv6 (::1) localhost redirections
- Regularly updated to include new ad and tracking domains
- Freely available for personal use under Creative Commons licensing

## File Structure

- First line: Standard localhost mapping
- Header with license and usage information
- Comprehensive list of blocked domains organized alphabetically
- Comments providing context and notes about specific entries

## Usage

### Installation

No specific installation required. This file can be used directly with operating systems that support hosts file modification.

```typescript
// Import the hosts file
import blockedHosts from './blocked-hosts';

// Example of using the hosts file
console.log(blockedHosts);
```

### System Integration

1. Locate your system's hosts file (typically in `/etc/hosts` on Unix-like systems or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows)
2. Append the contents of this file to your existing hosts file
3. Restart your network connection or computer

## Important Considerations

- Some blocked domains might affect functionality of certain websites or services
- Regularly update the hosts file to maintain effectiveness
- Always backup your original hosts file before modifications

## Licensing

## Technical Details

- Supported Platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, Unix-like systems
- IP Redirection Methods:
  - IPv4: 0.0.0.0
