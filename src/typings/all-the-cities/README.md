## Installation

To use these type definitions, you'll need to install both the type definitions and the original package:

```bash
npm install all-the-cities @types/all-the-cities
```

## Usage

### Basic Import
```typescript
import * as AllTheCities from 'all-the-cities';

// Example usage (based on typical city data libraries)
const cities = AllTheCities.getCities();
```

## Type Definitions

Since the provided declaration is minimal, the actual type structure is likely defined by the original package. Typical city data might include:

```typescript
interface City {
  name: string;
  country: string;
  population: number;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
}
```

## Requirements

- TypeScript 3.0+
- Node.js 10.0+
- all-the-cities package

## Limitations

- This is a minimal type declaration
- Actual type implementation depends on the original package
- Recommend checking the package documentation for precise type details

## Potential Methods (Speculative)

```typescript
declare module 'all-the-cities' {
  // Potential method signatures
  export function getCities(): City[];
  export function getCitiesByCountry(countryCode: string): City[];
  export function findCity(name: string): City | null;
}
```
