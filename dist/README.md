# Blocked Hosts Distribution (MVPS HOSTS File)

## Overview

This distribution contains a comprehensive HOSTS file from the MVPS (Mikkel's Very Private Stuff) project, designed to block advertising, tracking, and malicious domains. The file provides a curated list of domain mappings to effectively prevent unwanted network connections by redirecting potentially harmful domains to localhost (0.0.0.0).

## Key Components

- Domain Blocking: Redirects known advertising, tracking, and potentially harmful domains to 0.0.0.0
- IPv4 and IPv6 Support: Includes entries for both IPv4 and IPv6 localhost configurations
- Comprehensive Coverage: Blocks domains across various categories including ads, tracking, analytics, and more
